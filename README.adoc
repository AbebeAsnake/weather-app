= Simple weather app

== Getting started

To use this app, you need to register an http://openweathermap.org/appid[API Key] on the
http://openweathermap.org/[OpenWeatherApp] service.

Once you have it, the easiest way to get running it to set the following environment
property:

```
$ EXPORT APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=<yourkey>
```
